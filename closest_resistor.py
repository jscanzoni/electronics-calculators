'''
script to take an 
- array of resistors
- the desired output resistance 
- tolerance of the desired output resistance

to recommend the best combination of 1 to 5 resistors to use in either 
- parallel or 
- series 

to get the closest to the desired output resistance in both parallel and series along with the total resistance of the combination
